# Credit Card Fraud Detection

The idea behind the credit card technology actually dates back to the late 1800s, and comes from an utopian novel called Looking Backward, by Edward Bellamy (Wikipedia). However, we’d only begin to see anything like that in the 20th century, but nothing compared to what we have nowadays.
The fact is that credit cards have revolutionized the way we shop and live our lives, without having to walk around with loads of cash on our pockets. It is estimated that, in 2018, a total of 1.2 Billion cards were in circulation only in the US, with 72% of adults having at least one credit card.

Unfortunately, this technology opens up a whole new possibility for scams and frauds. These types os crime happen mostly when data from your card is obtained illegally through various sources, but mostly on database leakages or identity theft schemes (FBI).

However, there are quite many measures you can take in order to prevent having your data stolen. Just to name a few:

* Make sure the website you’re accessing has a valid security certificate;
* Don’t give out your information to anyone you don’t know;
* Don’t believe every product or investment offer you receive via e-mail or on a website.

In order to avoid this kind of fraud, banking companies are always trying to early identify these events, so that the card can be blocked and the transaction fails immediately.

With this in mind, we’ll utilize a dataset available on Kaggle about two days’ worth of transactions from an European bank in 2013, and develop a model to classify transactions as frauds or not.
